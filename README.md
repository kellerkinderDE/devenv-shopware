# Kellerkinder devenv

devenv provides a reproducible and declarative local development environment for our [Shopware](https://www.shopware.com) projects.
It uses the [Nix package system](https://nixos.org/) to provide native packages for all our required services. This environment is
tightly tailored to the needs of our team members working on various projects with Shopware 6.

### Notable Features:
- Overrides Shopware's default mailer configuration to use [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog)
- Provides helper functions to clear caches
- Enables XDebug without a performance impact when not using it
- Easily configurable PHP Version
- Inherits all default devenv features and services

### More Information:

### Setup
Copy all files from the example folder into a project and enter it (assuming you have direnv installed). Run `direnv allow` if it asks you to.

Make sure to run the following command to accelerate the startup process:
```bash
cachix use devenv ; cachix use fossar ; cachix use shopware
```


Add the following files to the project .gitignore file:
- .devenv*
- devenv.local.nix

### Different PHP versions

in your project devenv.nix file. The php.ini configuration is >php80 specific
and needs to be adjusted when using a lower version. 

- php56
- php70
- php71
